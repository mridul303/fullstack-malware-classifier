# Fullstack application for malware detection using CNN
This fullstack web application is written in ReactJS(Frontend) and FastAPI(Backend). The code uses VGG16 and Densenet for classification. You can change the code in `backend/classifiers.py` to use as many models you want. 
### Due to size limitations, the CNN models have not been uploaded. You have to train your model before running this application.

## Prerequisites
- python3.6+
- Node v10
- yarn
- Tensorflow

## Frontend setup
- cd to frontend folder
- run `nmp install`
  
## Backend setup
- cd to backend folder
- create a new directory called `trained_models` and copy your saved h5 model here
- run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Start the frontend server (within frontend folder):
